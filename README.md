# TPM-2-Bypass

I made a TPM 2 bypass so you can install win 11 without having to boot over usb or something
You need to have a win 11 bootable iso!

How to set up:
Press rightclick on the iso
Press: mount or on german: Bereitstellen
Than compile the .py to exe!
Than go onto the DVD drive (it got created by mounting it!)
and now run Setup! done!

(Optional: Disable internet while downloading! if you change the dword it creates to 0 again it will stop working when tryin to update just let it be 1 so you can update!)
